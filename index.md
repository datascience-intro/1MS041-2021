### Individual Auto-graded Assignment Preparation

* Assignment 1 assesses comprehension of the lecture companion SageMath-Kernel (9.1+) Jupyter notebooks `00-05.ipynb`
* Assignment 2 assesses comprehension of the lecture companion SageMath-Kernel (9.1+) Jupyter notebooks `06-12.ipynb`

### Starting package
* Download the [Starting package](starting_package.zip) (latest update Wed Oct  6 13:20-ish hours UTC 2021)
* Unzip this into a folder that you will use as the base folder
* Whenever you download the next lectures as `ipynb` files, you put them in the same place as `00.ipynb` and `01.ipynb`, this way all pathways will be the same for all of us.
