### Starting package
* Download the [Starting package](starting_package.zip)
* Unzip this into a folder that you will use as the base folder
* Whenever you download the next lectures as `ipynb` files, you put them in the same place as `00.ipynb` and `01.ipynb`, this way all pathways will be the same for all of us.
