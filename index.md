## Introduction to Data Science 1MS041

### Individual SageMath Jupyter .ipynb Notebooks

* [00. Introduction](00.md)
* [01. BASH crash](01.md)
* [02. Numbers, Strings, Booleans and Sets](02.md)
* [03. Map, Function, Collection, and Probability](03.md)
* [04. Conditional Probability, Random Variables, Loops and Conditionals](04.md)
* [05. Random Variables, Expectations, Data, Statistics, Arrays and Tuples, Iterators and Generators](05.md)

### Starting package
* Download the [Starting package](Files/first_lecture_and_data.zip)
* Unzip this into a folder that you will use as the base folder
* Whenever you download the next lectures as `ipynb` files, you put them in the same place as `00.ipynb` and `01.ipynb`, this way all pathways will be the same for all of us.

### Other files
If you want to do everything yourself, here is the data-zip file, [Only Data](Files/data.zip).
In case you have images that dont show up, here is the images-zip file, [Only Images](Files/images.zip)
