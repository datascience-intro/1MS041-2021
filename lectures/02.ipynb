    "The key is to remember that sets are unordered:  a set {1, 2, 3} is the same as the set {2, 1, 3} is the same as the set {3, 1, 2} ...  (soon we will talk about ordered collections like lists where order is important - but for the moment just remember that a set is about collections of unique values or objects). Remember also that the (lower case s) set is a python type (in contrast to the 'more mathy' SageMath Set with a capital S).  For many 'non-mathy' computing purposes, what matters about a set is the speed of being able to find things in the set without making it expensive (in computer power) to add and remove things, and the best way of doing this (invisible to the programmer actually using the set) is to base the set on a [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table).  In practical terms what this means is that the ordering that Sage uses to actually display a set is related to the hash values it has given to the elements in the set which may be totally unrelated to what you or I would think of as any obvious ordering based on the magnitude of the values in the set, or the order in which we put them in, etc.   Remember, you don't need to know anything about hash values and the 'under-the-hood' construction of sets for this course - this explanation is just to give a bit more background."
