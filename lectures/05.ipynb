    "## Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variable is a mapping from the sample space $\\Omega$ to the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$.  In other words, it is a numerical value determined by the outcome of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already saw *discrete random variables* that take values in a discrete set, of two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- those with with finitely many values, eg. the two values in $\\{0,1\\}$ for the Bernoulli$(\\theta)$ RV \n",
    "- those with *countably infinitely many* values, eg. values in the set of all non-negative integers: $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}$, for the 'infinite coin tossing experiment' that records the number of consecutive 'Tails' you see before the first 'Heads' occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will see the other main type of real-valued random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous random variable\n",
    "\n",
    "When a random variable takes on values in the continuum we call it a continuous RV.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- Volume of water that fell on the Southern Alps yesterday (See video link below)\n",
    "- Vertical position above sea level, in micrometers, since the original release of a pollen grain at the head waters of a river\n",
    "- Resting position in degrees of a roulettet wheel after a brisk spin\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Density Function\n",
    "\n",
    "A RV $X$ with DF $F$ is called continuous if there exists a piece-wise continuous function $f$, called the  probability density function (PDF) $f$ of $X$, such that, for any $a$, $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(a < X \\le b) = F(b)-F(a) = \\int_a^b f(x) \\ dx \\ .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "The following hold for a continuous RV $X$ with PDF $f$:\n",
    "\n",
    "For any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $P(X=x)=0$.\n",
    "Consequentially, for any $a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $a \\le b$ \n",
    "$$P(a < X < b ) = P(a < X \\le b) = P(a \\leq X \\le b) = P(a \\le X < b)$$\n",
    "By the fundamental theorem of calculus, except possibly at finitely many points (where the continuous pieces come together in the piecewise-continuous $f$): \n",
    "$$f(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} F(x)$$\n",
    "And of course $f$ must satisfy:\n",
    "$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\ dx = P(-\\infty < X < \\infty) = 1$$\n",

    "Thus, balls labelled by the number 1 come up 29 times in the first ball drawn (Ball One) out of 1,114 Lotto trials.   Similarly, the number 2 comes up 28 times, ... 40 comes up 37 times.  Of course, these numbers would be different if you have downloaded a more recent data file with additional trials!\n",
    "\n",
    "So what?   Well, we'd hope that the lotto is fair, i.e. that the probability of each ball coming up with any of the available numbers is the same for each number:   the probability that Ball One is a 1 is the same as the probability that it is 2, is the same as the probability that it is 3,..... , is the same as the probability that it is 40.   If the lotto is fair, the number that comes up on each ball should be a discrete uniform random variable.  More formally, we would expect it to be the de Moivre$(\\frac{1}{40}, \\frac{1}{40}, \\ldots, \\frac{1}{40})$ RV as lectured.   Over the long term, we'd expect the number of times each number comes up on a given trial to be about the same as the number of times any other number comes up on that trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have data from 1987 to 2008, and a first step to assessing the fairness of the lotto (for Ball One, anyway) could be to just visualise the data.   We can use the list of points we created above and the SageMath plotting function points to plot a simple graphic like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are plotting the frequency with which each number comes up against the numbers themselves, but it is a bit hard to see what number on the ball each red point relates to.   To deal with this we add dotted lines going up from the number on the horizontal axis to the corresponding (number, frequency) tuple plotted as a red point.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these plots let us use SageMath Graphics primitives: `point`, `points` and `line`, and their `+` operations for superimpositions."

If there are no more elements in the stream, next() must raise the StopIteration exception. Iterators don’t have to be finite, though; it’s perfectly reasonable to write an iterator that produces an infinite stream of data.\n",

When the function reaches a return statement, the local variables are destroyed and the value is returned to the caller. A later call to the same function creates a new private namespace and a fresh set of local variables. But, what if the local variables weren’t thrown away on exiting a function? What if you could later resume the function where it left off? This is what generators provide; they can be thought of as resumable functions.\n",

On executing the yield expression, the generator outputs the value of i, similar to a return statement.
